We've all had that awkward scenario when we join in on a Teams / Zoom / Discord call and there's an elephant in thr room: no one knows what too say. We have create a service using Microsoft Azure Speech services that automatically translates speech to text in the background and uses advanced machine learning algorithms to provide users with helpful articles and topic suggestions to keep the conversation going.

By strengthening the connections we already have, we hope our users can maintain a consistent and healthier relationship with their network while living at home or alone.
